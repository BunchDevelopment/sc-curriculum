# Week 1 Homework

## Due to Stephanie by next Wednesday

1. If you have not done so yet â€“ create an account for yourself on www.github.com (name should be professional)
2. Create your capstone repo (in a new folder) and add a docs folder.
   > **Important**: Remember to use the [Savvy Starter Repo Template](https://github.com/savvy-coders/savvy-starter) for this!
3. Create a docs folder, add all your project documentation in the form of markdown, images or PDFs.
4. Update your README.md file to link to your new project documentation.
5. Your documentation should include...
   - Definition of your audience
   - Definition statement (I want to create a web application that...) for your project
   - High level story (elevator pitch)
   - Outline of the content
   - User Flow
   - Wireframes (1 wireframe per page minimum, hand-drawn is ok!)
