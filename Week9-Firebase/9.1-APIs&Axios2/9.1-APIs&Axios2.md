# Third-Party APIs and Auth
We've seen how useful it can be to integrate other developers' code into our projects through the use of libraries and open-source modules. But it can also be helpful to leverage the same RESTful API pattern to include _data_ from third parties as well - we did this with our Blog page and the placeholder JSON data.

There are many open APIs, but most of them are not _quite_ as open as the placeholder JSON data API that we worked with earlier. While computing power is cheap, it's not _free_, and most APIs require at least a little bit of hoop-jumping to get to their data.

## Query Params
In a RESTful API, a resource is usually accessed by name at a unique route, e.g. `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` vs `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`. We know that these are going to be different "things", so they get different endpoints. But what about when we want to add some extra data to our "query" of this resource?

One common pattern is to use a **query param**. You can see a _query param_ in action when you perform a Google search. If you search for "Adorable Puppies", your results page probably has a URL of something like `https://google.com/?q=Adorable+Puppies` (plus some other query params with info about you). Everything after the `?` represents a bit of extra information about your search!

Let's see how `openweathermap.org` uses query params to protect and refine responses from their weather API.

## OpenWeatherMap
OpenWeatherMap is a service that includes a free-to-use API that can give you information about weather conditions anywhere around the world. This is pretty powerful for developers, but the maintainers of this API need some way of making sure that users don't abuse this system or bring down the API by making too many requests at once!

To manage traffic, OpenWeatherMap uses something called an **API key**. This is a unique identifier that allows `api.openweathermap.org` to restrict its responses to users with an account and to stop responding if users send too many requests in a short amount of time.

1. First, register for an API key at [`openweathermap.org`](https://openweathermap.org/appid#get). Hopefully you did this before class, because it takes a couple hours for the API key to activate!
2. Let's try to visit the API without a key. Go to [`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather) in your browser. What's the response?
3. Try again, but this time use an `APPID` _query param_ to access the restricted endpoint (i.e. `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?APPID=$YOUR_API_KEY`). What's the response now?
4. We're getting access to the API, but we aren't quite making a correct request. Let's examine the [API documentation for current weather](https://openweathermap.org/current).
5. Not only do we need to provide our API key as a query param, but also we need to specify a city (and chain our query params with `&`)
    ```
    api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={your api key}
    ```
    Let's add St. Louis as a query param:
    ```
    api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=st louis&appid={your api key}
    ```
6. That's more like it! How can we store this in state? We first use `axios` to get the data from our API endpoint, then we can use that data to populate a new piece of state. In our example, we are creating a new key (`weather`) in `state.Home` that holds some weather data as an Object.

   ```javascript
   axios
     .get(/* your API endpoint from above */)
     .then(response => {
       state.Home.weather.city = response.name;
       state.Home.weather.temp = response.main.temp;
       state.Home.weather.description = response.weather.main;
     });
   ```

6. Now we can display our weather info on our home page!

## Request Headers and Authorization
Sometimes, APIs will use query params and API keys to limit usage. More often, though, secure requests are made with the use of **request headers**. Every network request in your browser includes some extra information about that request by default. This extra information can include things like the type of content that's expected in a response, the origin of the request, and, perhaps, some type of _semi_-secret information about the application making a request - like an API key!. When you inspect one of these requests in a browser's dev tools, you can read any of these request headers.

Let's find the request headers that are made when your browser requests your main `index.html` file when developing locally.
1. Click the "Network" tab in Chrome's dev tools.
2. If it looks "blank", hit refresh to capture the request-response network information.
3. Click the first "localhost" you see listed on the left, then look to the right for "Response Headers"

### GitHub API
The [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) uses an [`Authorization`](https://developer.github.com/v3/) header to restrict access to much of its API. We can implement **custom headers** in our application with `axios` through a _second parameter_ given to to `get`. Let's give it a whirl!

First, let's sign up for a GitHub personal token. We'll use this token as an API key through the `Authorization` header.
1. Go to Settings by clicking your profile image in the top right corner and selecting "Settings"
2. In Settings, select "Developer Settings" at the bottom of the list of categories.
3. Select "Personal Access Tokens", then click the "Generate new token" button.
4. Enter your password to pass to the next screen.
5. Enter a note about what the token is for ("API practice", for example), select the "repo" scope, and click the "Generate token" button at the bottom of the page.
6. Copy your token, then paste it in a new file called `GHtoken`
    > **NOTE**: this `GHtoken` file is meant as a temporary storage spot. Don't commit this file to GitHub! If you need to make commits before migrating your token to a more secure place, either add this file to your `.gitignore`, or avoid adding the file to any commits).

    You won't be able to see or copy your token once you navigate away from the page!
7. Now that we have our token, we can make an API request with a custom header. Let's query our GitHub account for information about your public repositories with the following syntax:
    ```javascript
    axios
      .get(`https://api.github.com/users/${YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/repos`, {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `token ${YOUR_GH_TOKEN}`
        }
      })
      .then(response => console.log(response.data));
    ```
    In our `get` method, the first parameter is the API endpoint we are querying and the second is an Object that represents our custom header:
    ```javascript
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `token ${YOUR_GH_TOKEN}`
      }
    }
    ```

## `dotenv`
So far, this "security" isn't doing us much good if we still have to hard code our API keys/tokens into our JS (which is then pushed to GitHub for all the world to see...). Luckily, we have a third-party module that can create hidden **environment variables**: [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

1. Install `dotenv`
    ```
    npm install --save dotenv
    ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add our GitHub token to a line (we can delete our `GHtoken` file now too):
    ```
    GITHUB_USERNAME=<your GitHub username here>
    GITHUB_TOKEN=<your GitHub token here>
    SOME_API_KEY=<some API key>
    ```
    Each line `.env` is for a new variable, and we don't separate our variables with commas or semi-colons. Also, because these are fixed, "hard" variables, we use upper case and snake case (i.e. UPPER_AND_SNAKE_CASE).
3. We never want to give GitHub access to our `.env` file, so we need to add `.env` to our `.gitignore`.
4. Next, let's create a `env.js` file in our root directory. In this file, we `import dotenv` and call the `config()` method which reads the `.env` file, parses it, and assigns it to `process.env`.
    ```javascript
    import dotenv from "dotenv"

    dotenv.config();
    ```
5. To access our environment variables in a JS file, we need to `import` our `env.js` file. Then we can access our environment variables from the `process.env` Object.
    ```javascript
    import "./env"

    axios.get(`https://api.github.com/users/${process.env.GITHUB_USERNAME}/repos`,
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `token ${process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN}`
        }
    })
    .then(response => console.log(response.data));
    ```
