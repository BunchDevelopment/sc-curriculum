# Getting Started with Your Local Development Environment

## Setting Up a Local Development Environment
### Development Tools
To get things started, we need to download a few things for our **development environment**. These include the following:

1. A bash-friendly **C**ommand-**L**ine **I**nterface (CLI)
2. A version-control system - git
3. A text editor - VS Code
4. A dependency-management utility - npm
5. A native client for Slack - Slack app

The process for each of these things should depend a bit on your operating system, but should help us work together in a consistent environment for the rest of the course.

### Developer Accounts
You'll also need a few online accounts to get started. These should _all be tied to the same email address_! These external accounts include:

1. Slack
2. GitHub
3. Netlify

#### Slack

All of our communication will go through the class-specific Slack channel! Please sign up for an account (if you haven't already) and download the slack client for your OS through your package manager.

#### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) profiles are like a combination of LinkedIn and Facebook for developers, as well as a place to back up and store code. We'll learn more about how git and GitHub work later, but for now, it's important to create an account. When you've created an account, post a link to Slack, and follow the profiles of your classmates and instructors!

#### Netlify

Once you have a GitHub account, you can sign up for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). We'll use Netlify for [Continuous Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)
