# A Savvy Coders Hack-A-Thon
It's almost time to use what we've learned to create a Student Showcase for you and your classmates. First, though, we need to learn about how to work on shared codebases through git and GitHub. While this can be pretty complicated, you'll find that it gives us a lot of power as a team!

## The Integrator Workflow
![blessed repo workflow](https://dirac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/integrationModel.png)

For our group project, we'll be using the 'Blessed Repository'/integrator workflow, simplified a bit for our needs. The important thing to remember with this workflow is that there will be LOTS of copies of the same codebase with little variations between each copy. The copies shown in the chart above are:

1. The Blessed Repository: this is the "_product_"/production repo - the fully-merged and up-to-date "working" codebase. Each developer will have the ability to copy (or fetch) data from this repository, but won't be able to directly change (or push) anything on the Blessed Repository. 
2. Integration Manager's Personal Copy: "Integration manager" is a term for the person in charge of merging/_integrating_ everyone's changes together. Developers don't have direct access of any kind to the IM's personal copy of the Blessed Repository. The instructor will be your IM/team leader for the night!

> **NOTE**: For our purposes, the production repo and integration manager's repo will be the same repo and will be managed by the instructor.

3. Developer's Public Copy: each of you will have a copy (or 'fork') of the project hosted on GitHub. All changes made to Blessed Repository will have to be submitted through your public project repo (more on that later).
4. Developer's Private Copy: GitHub will only store your code. You'll need a local copy to edit files, and you'll sync that local copy with your public repository _and_ the Blessed Repository.

> **GOAL**: keep your Public and Private copies _as close to the Blessed Repository as possible at all times_ without causing **merge conflicts** or **overwriting** your work!

## Student Showcase Setup
1. **Fork** the instructor's integration/production repo and clone it to your machine - [link to instructor's repo](https://github.com/ambientstl/savvy-coders-hack-a-thon-1)

2. If you type in `git remote`, you should see a single `remote`, called `origin`, available to you. This remote was set up automatically when you ran `git clone`, and points to your public copy on GitHub. Anyone can set up a remote to `pull` from any repository, but only you have `push` access to the repositories on your GitHub account. The same applies to your instructor's copy: you can set up a remote to `pull` data, but you can't use that remote to `push` to it. To set up that `remote`, navigate to your instructor's public copy of the codebase on GitHub, copy that repo's https address (just like you did on your own account with clone), and type the following into your console: 
```
git remote add <remote name> <repo url>
```
Now, when you type `git remote`, you should see two remotes: `<remote name>` and `origin`. 

## Student Showcase Directions
### Integrator Workflow
1. Edit the README.md file to **add your name and a link to your GitHub profile page** to the _Contributors_ section
2. `add`, `commit`, and `push` your changes to your public GitHub repo
3. On your public repo, **create a new pull request** and add a comment to describe your changes
> **GitHub Pull Requests**
> 1. Click the "Pull requests" tab at the top of your GitHub repo
> 2. Click the green "New pull request" button in the top right
> 3. Examine your commits/changes and check for merge conflicts, then click the green "Create pull request" button on the left
> 4. Write a comment that describes the changes you made
> 5. Click the "Create pull request" button on the right to submit your pull request

4. After the instructor accepts and closes your request, update your repositories with the integration repo
```
git fetch --all
git reset --hard <repo name>/master
```
* `git fetch --all` gathers all the data from all remotes
* `git reset --hard  <repo name>/master` resets your local copy to the `master` branch of the `<repo name>` repository


> **Integrator Workflow Loop (Developer)**
> * **Push** local commits to public repo
> * Submit **pull request** on GitHub
> * _Wait_ for the pull request to close
> * **Fetch** data from all remotes
> * **Reset** local codebase

### Your Student Showcase Block
Find the HTML block that corresponds to your number in the README and **only** edit that block to prevent merge conflicts.

> **NOTE**: You can either **directly alter the HTML** _or_ use **JS DOM methods** to alter your HTML block. If you use DOM methods, make sure to link your `.js` file to the HTML with a `<script>` tag.

#### Add the following features to your block:
* Your picture
* Your project name and a link to your project's GitHub repo
* Three of of the following:
  1. Contact/social media list
  2. A quote
  3. A list of hobbies or favorites
  4. A fun fact
  5. A bio paragraph
* Personalized CSS styling that only targets your block or the specific elements within your block

If students finish their blocks early, communicate among each other to work on styling the _whole page_ including the **background color**, **header**, **footer**, and a **summary paragraph**.
