## Relational Data

In the last lesson, we used `express` to build on our `lowdb`-based blog post API. While `lowdb` works for the simplest cases, it does not do well with _relational data_. Relational data is a way of modeling data through its relationships, organizing entity categories into a single structure (often "tables") with many properties ("columns") and instances of that entity ("rows") that is related to other entities through unique identifiers. This is a similar model to spreadsheets or other forms of columnar data presentation. By building our persistent data stores (or "databases") around this relational model, we can then enforce guarantees about those relationships, and we can query for subsets of entities through their relationships with one another more easily.

That's all a bit abstract, so let's take a look at a more concrete example using our existing `/posts` resource. At the moment, we only have one entity in our database (a `post`) which looks like this in JSON form:

```javascript
{
  "body": "This is a blog post",
  "id": "79fa42ee-1c92-4a34-b55a-d37b0a8bc2e0"
}
```

Every post is unique, and there are a number of properties that we could add that would continue to be unique to that blog post, e.g.:

```javascript
{
  "title": "Post Number 1",
  "body": "This is a blog post",
  "id": "79fa42ee-1c92-4a34-b55a-d37b0a8bc2e0",
  "published": 1597592298458
}
```

But what about including information about the author of a post? Let's include the `authorName` in each post, too:

```javascript
[
  {
    "authorName": "Test Testerson"
    "title": "Post Number 1",
    "body": "This is a blog post",
    "id": "79fa42ee-1c92-4a34-b55a-d37b0a8bc2e0",
    "published": 1597592298458
  },
  {
    "authorName": "Test Testerson",
    "title": "Post Number 2",
    "body": "This is a blog post",
    "id": "89fa42ee-1c92-4a34-b55a-d37bsldflk8c",
    "published": 1597592298458
  },
]
```

While this works, there's a problem: we probably want to include a lot more information about an Author than their name. What if they need to log in? Do they get a username and a password? What about an email address, or a _nom de plume_ versus a legal name? While we could include all of that information in every post that author contributes, maintaining that ever-changing collection of information inside the `post` entity would be a nightmare. Instead, we'd probably want to include a separate `author` resource that is then _referenced_ in the `post` resource. Something like:

```javascript
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "authorId": "79fee662u-1c92-4a34-b55a-d37675ikkC"
      "title": "Post Number 1",
      "body": "This is a blog post",
      "id": "79fa42ee-1c92-4a34-b55a-d37b0a8bc2e0",
      "published": 1597592298458
    },
    {
      "authorId": "79fee662u-1c92-4a34-b55a-d37675ikkC"
      "title": "Post Number 2",
      "body": "This is a blog post",
      "id": "89fa42ee-1c92-4a34-b55a-d37bsldflk8c",
      "published": 1597592298460
    },
  ],
  "authors": [
    {
      "id": "79fee662u-1c92-4a34-b55a-d37675ikkC",
      "name": "Test Testerson",
      "email": "test@testerson.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

We now have a relationship between _posts_ and _authors_. This is a good thing! Now we can make sure that author records can be as rich as they need to be without affecting the ergonomics of posts, and we can better adhere to the RESTful principle of Unique Resource Identifiers by exposing separate `posts` and `authors` endpoints. Let's re-organize our API to include an `authors` resource as well!

<!-- TODO: Add title, published, and authorId properties to each post -->
<!-- TODO: Use separate routers to model the posts and authors resources in express -->
<!-- TODO: Expose additional /authors/:id/posts route -->

<!-- TODO: Explain referential integrity -->
<!-- TODO: Install postgresql -->
<!-- TODO: Set up connection pool and shared db -->
<!-- TODO: Refactor all of the above with postgres through psql -->
<!-- TODO: Deploy all of the above -->
<!-- TODO: Use migrations to handle deployed schema vs local schema -->
