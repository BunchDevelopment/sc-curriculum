# Data Modeling with State
A **data model** emphasizes _what data is needed_ and _how it should be organized_. Our data model (**state**) captures all the details about our app as data. When constructing our data model/state Object, we need to consider _what information_ we need to keep track of as well as _which views_ need what information. 

Our state Object will come from modules housed in the **`store`** folder. While there is no single "correct" way to model your data or structure state, we will add to `store` a module for each section of HTML we want to populate with data from state: each view (_Home_, _Bio_, _Gallery_, _Form_) as well as the navigation _Links_. Like our `components` folder, our `store` folder will also contain an `index.js` _aggregator module_. 

# M-V-U Architecture
**Model-View-Update** architecture is based on the [MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) with a main difference being that MVU architecture maintains _unidirectional_ (one-way) data flow. 

* **Model** (_state_) - the _data model_ for the current _state_ of the application's data.
* **View** (_components/views & `render()`_) - the `render` function and functional components that _take in model/state_ as an argument and _output HTML_. The functional components use the data from state to populate the site's HTML. 
* **Update** (_event handlers) - event handlers attached to our HTML that listen for user input and use it to alter the _state_/model. 

So, our **model** is passed into and rendered by our **view** which then handles user input to **updates** the _model_, which is then passed into and rendered by our _view_ which then listens for user input that _updates_ our model, which is then passed into... etc.

# Activity: State-Driven SPA
### Let's convert our stateless SPA from yesterday into a state-driven SPA
1. Make sure you completed each step from the activity at the end of [yesterday's lesson](../7.2-SPAComponents/7.2-SPAComponents.md), including #15 where we break up our `components/Main.js` into separate `view` modules
2. First, let's alter our form a little to make it more suitable for our purposes. Instead of a "generic" form with inputs for username, password, and email, let's create a form that accepts an image url and image description so the user can dynamically add pictures to the gallery
    * Alter the `username` input/label to accept a `url` text input
    * Alter the `password` input/label to accept a `title`/description text input
    * Delete the `email` input/label
    * Change the `value` for the `submit` input
3. Let's begin to construct our state by creating a directory named `store` in the root level of our repo.
4. Inside of `store`, create the following JS files:
    * Home.js
    * Bio.js
    * Gallery.js
    * Form.js
    * Links.js (for our nav bar)
    * index.js
5. Inside `Links.js`, let's export an Array that contains the names of all of our pages/views. We want our Links to be formatted in exactly the same way as the names of our `view` modules, so capitalization will be important. Also, keep in mind that the order of our array will reflect the order of the links in our nav bar.
    ```javascript
    export default ["Home", "Bio", "Gallery", "Form"]
    ```
6. Inside each JS file that corresponds to a view (Home, Bio, Gallery, Form), let's export an Object with `header` and `view` keys. We will set `view` to the name of its corresponding view module and `header` to the heading we want to display on that view. 
    ```javascript
    export default {
      header: "My Home Page",
      view: "Home"
    }
    ```
7. Inside `store/index.js`, let's aggregate each of our modules with one-line import/export statements.
    ```javascript
    export { default as Mod1 } from "./Mod1"
    export { default as Mod2 } from "./Mod2"
    ...
    ```
8. Now our state modules are prepped and collected and ready to import. In our root `index.js`, let's `import` our state modules as a module Object named `state`.
    ```javascript
    import * as state from "./store"
    ```
9. Now that we have access to state, we can set up our render function to accept it. The way our data is modelled, it doesn't make much sense to pass in the _entire_ state Object. Instead, we will add a parameter that represents a _piece_ of state to be rendered. 
    * We also want to pass that _same piece of state_ into some functional components. `Header()`, `Nav()`, and `Main()` all need pieces of state. State doesn't have any information for our footer section, so it can remain stateless.    
    * Unlike our header and "main" section of our site, we want our navigation bar to remain similar no matter which view we are rendering. Let's bypass the specific piece of state being passed in to render and directly access the piece of state we created just for `Nav()` - `state.Links`.
    * Our `Header` and `Main` functional components need to know which specific piece of state is being rendered in order to display the correct information. Let's pass our parameter into each.
    * Don't forget to pass `state.Home` into our initial render function so our home page appears when our site first loads.
    ```javascript
    function render(st) {
      document.querySelector("#root").innerHTML = `
        ${Header(st)}
        ${Nav(state.Links)}
        ${Main(st)}
        ${Footer()}
      `;
    }

    render(state.Home);
    ```
10. Our render function is accepting a piece of state and calling our functional components with pieces of state, however, we need to change our functional components to know what to do with that information.
    * In `components/Header.js`, add a parameter to our exported function that represents a piece of state. Inside of our `<h1>`, replace "Example SPA" with the "variable" `st.header`
    * In `components/Nav.js`, add a parameter to our exported function that represents a list of text/titles for links. Delete the HTML list items and use an array method to construct the list items from the Array.
    ```javascript
    // constructing HTML list items from array
    //  - .map reformats the elements in the array into html and constructs a new array from the results
    //  - .join creates one long string from the array
    arr.map(el => `<li><a href="#">${el}</a></li>`).join()
    ```
    * In `components/Main.js`, add a parameter to our exported function that represents a piece of state. Since we are only rendering one view at a time, we only need to invoke one functional component from `views`: remove any extras. Use the piece of state to access the correct functional component in `views`, then pass in the piece of state to the function. 
    ```javascript
    views[st.view](st)
    ```
11. Our website will now render our home page, but our navigation links don't work yet. Let's add some event listeners to handle clicks on our nav bar.
    1. In our root `index.js`, create a function called `addNavEventListeners`.
    2. Inside our function, query the DOM for all `a` tags that are children of `nav` elements.
    3. At the end of your DOM query, chain a `.forEach` method that adds an event listener to each element.
    4. Inside our event listener, we listen for a click. When we handle a click, we must first call `preventDefault()` on our event, then use data from the event - `event.target.textContent` - to reference a piece of state which is passed into the render function.
    ```javascript
    // using the event to reference a piece of state which is passed into render
    render(state[event.target.textContent])
    ```
    5. Inside our render function, at the end after constructing the HTML for our page, call `addNavEventListeners`
12. We can navigate through our views/pages, but our gallery is broken. Let's move and adapt some previous features to construct our `img` elements, much like we did with our `nav` list items. 
    1. In `store/Gallery.js`, add a property to the exported Object called `pictures`. Move the Array of pictures from our root `index.js` into the Object as the value of `pictures`
    2. In `view/Gallery.js`, add a parameter to our exported function that represents a piece of state (always `state.Gallery` if the rest of our JS is set up correctly). Inside `<section>`, use an array method to construct the `img` elements from `st.pictures`. 
    ```javascript
    // using reduce to construct HTML images from array
    pictureList.reduce((html, curr) => `${html} <img src=${curr.url} alt=${curr.title}>`, ``)
    ```
    3. In our root `index.js`, we can now remove the functionality that populated our gallery with pictures
13. Now we just need to change our form handler to listen for submissions, then add the submission to `state.Gallery.pictures`. 
    1. In our root `index.js` lets create a new function called `addPicOnFormSubmit`
    2. Inside our function, query the DOM for the `form` element and add an event listener that listens for a submission.
    3. When the form is submitted, prevent the event's default behavior and construct a new picture object with keys of `url` and `title`.
    ```javascript
    let pictureObject = { 
      url: inputList[0].value, 
      title: inputList[1].value
    }
    ```
    4. Now let's add/`push` our new picture object to state with the rest of our picture objects - `state.Gallery.pictures` 
    5. Finally, we can remove our original form handling functionality from our root `index.js`, leaving us with a relatively clean file with only a few functions. 



































## Portfolio Project 1

### Modular State and Content

When last we left our state tree, it was beginning to look something like this:

```javascript
const states = {
  Home: {
    links: ["Blog", "Contact", "Projects"],
    title: "Welcome to my Portfolio"
  },
  Blog: {
    links: ["Home", "Contact", "Projects"],
    title: "Welcome to my Blog"
  },
  Contact: {
    links: ["Home", "Blog", "Projects"],
    title: "Contact Me"
  },
  Projects: {
    links: [
      "Home",
      "Blog",
      "Contact",
      "Choose-Your-Own-Adventure",
      "Rock-Paper-Scissors"
    ],
    title: "Check out some of my projects"
  }
};
```

This is pretty ungainly. Let's see if we can clean this up by extracting all of these disparate states into their own modules.

1. To start, let's create a directory called `store` that will contain all of our `state`s. Inside that `store` directory, create a single `index.js` file. This file will act similarly to the way the `index.html` does for HTML documents: our bundler will, by default, look for that `index` if no explicit file path is provided.
2. Inside of `store`, let's create a separate JavaScript file for each part of our state tree, That means new `Home`, `Blog`, `Contact`, and `Projects` files. Each of these files should have a single `default` export of a single Object. That Object should represent that single piece of the original state tree. So, for example, the `Blog` module would look like this:

   ```javascript
   export default {
     links: ["Home", "Contact", "Projects"],
     title: "Welcome to my Blog"
   };
   ```

3. Once every state module has been created, we can re-export each of those modules with a name in `store/index.js`. The syntax for one of those re-exports would be `export { default as SomeName } from './some-location';`. See if you can re-export all of these pieces of our state tree with this syntax! HINT:

   ```javascript
   export { default as Blog } from "./Blog";
   export { default as Contact } from "./Contact";
   export { default as Home } from "./Home";
   export { default as Projects } from "./Projects";
   ```

4. Now that this base module has been set up we should be able to `import` our states through the module system. In this case, we would like to `import` _all_ of the states in one big glob using the `* as name` syntax. Try the following in your root-level `index.js` file, and see if you can figure out what the data type of `states` will be:

   ```javascript
   import * as states from "./store";

   console.log(states); // what's the data type here?
   ```

5. We should now be able to access any piece of our `states` tree, just as before! Except that this time, all of the complexity of our application state is hidden away behind our module system \(which is a _good_ thing\).
6. Now that we've ironed out navigation, let's see if we can finally get our _content_ to change in response to our user input! You should still have HTML files that represent content for your `Blog`, `Content`, and `Projects` landing pages that we haven't yet incorporated into our new Single-Page architecture. Let's convert those pieces of HTML into their own `component`s. To start, let's create a `Pages` directory inside our `components` directory. This is a common pattern when dealing with a group of similar components. In this case, we're grouping all of the different page-level \(or content-level\) templates.
7. Let's repeat the export pattern from our `states`. That means creating an `index.js` file next to a `Blog.js`, `Contact.js`, `Home.js`, and `Projects.js` file inside of `components/Pages`. Each Page component should `export` some HTML as a template literal, e.g.:

   ```javascript
   export default `
     <form>
       <input type="text" name="test">
       <input type="submit">
     </form>
   `;
   ```

   ...and re-`export` those `default`s with a name from `components/Pages/index.js`, e.g.:

   ```javascript
   export { default as Contact } from './Contact';
   ```

8. Now each `state` component can point to a component from the `components/Pages` directory. Let's use a String to connect that content to each state component as a `body` property. For example, our `Blog` state might become:

   ```javascript
   export default {
     body: "Blog",
     links: ["Home", "Contact", "Projects"],
     title: "Welcome to my Blog"
   };
   ```

9. Once you've associated some content with each piece of the state tree, it's time to change our `Content` component to allow for variation in the `body` property of a `state` parameter. That means our `Content` component becomes:

   ```javascript
   import * as pages from "./Pages";

   export default function Content(state) {
     return `
       <div id="content">
         ${pages[state.body]} // why do we need square brackets?
       </div>
     `;
   }
   ```

Now you should have a Single-Page application that behaves almost exactly like our old HTML page-based site, but with a lot more flexibility and some real performance wins for our users.
### SPA navigation

Up to this point, we haven't been able to see any of our other pages. Let's see if we can render the contents of these other by mimicking the routing behavior of the browser!

1. Let's start by wrapping all of our rendering logic into a single function:

   ```javascript
   // change our original state to home-specific state
   const home = {
     title: "Welcome to my Savvy Coders Portfolio"
   };

   const root = document.querySelector("#root"); // this doesn't need to be queried every time we re-render

   function render(state) {
     root.innerHTML = `
       ${Navigation(state)}
       ${Header(state)}
       ${Content(state)}
       ${Footer(state)}
     `;
   }

   render(home); // start by rendering the landing page
   ```

2. If everything from part 1 went as planned, you should see no difference on your landing page. Let's start by coming up with a new state for your first link. Perhaps:

   ```javascript
   // assuming your first link is to your blog page
   const blog = {
     title: "Welcome to my blog!"
   };
   ```

3. Now where should put our event listeners? We can't put them _before_ `render`, since we can't apply listeners to elements before they've been rendered. And we also need to _re-apply_ listeners after each render. That means that we should include the event listeners inside of `render`, but after `innerHTML` has been overwritten, _a la_:

   ```javascript
   function render(state) {
     root.innerHTML = `
       ${Navigation(state)}
       ${Header(state)}
       ${Content(state)}
       ${Footer(state)}
     `;

     document
       .querySelector("#navigation a") // grabs first link only
       .addEventListener("click", event => {
         event.preventDefault(); // stops page reload

         render(blog); // re-render on click
       });
   }
   ```

4. Let's repeat the process for your `contact` and `projects` links! As you work through this problem set, can you think of some limitations with this approach?


### Better SPA Navigation

At the end of the last exercise, your `render` function probably looked something like this:

```javascript
function render(state) {
  root.innerHTML = `
    ${Navigation(state)}
    ${Header(state)}
    ${Content(state)}
    ${Footer(state)}
  `;

  document.querySelector("#navigation a").addEventListener("click", event => {
    event.preventDefault();

    render(blog);
  });

  document
    .querySelector("#navigation li:nth-child(2) > a")
    .addEventListener("click", event => {
      event.preventDefault();

      render(contact);
    });

  document
    .querySelector("#navigation li:nth-child(3) > a")
    .addEventListener("click", event => {
      event.preventDefault();

      render(projects);
    });
}
```

That's neither `DRY` nor pretty... just look as those nasty selectors that we need to select each anchor tag in turn. Let's see if we can clean this up using the power of `event.target`.

1. First, let's refactor our states. You probably have four separate state Objects by this point. If we combine them into one flat state Object, then it will be easier to leverage the power of `event.target`. Let's do something like this:

   ```javascript
   // notice the capitalized property names!

   const state = {
     Blog: {
       title: "Welcome to my Blog"
     },
     Home: {
       title: "Welcome to my Portfolio"
     },
     Contact: {
       title: "Contact Me"
     },
     Projects: {
       title: "Check out my Projects"
     }
   };
   ```

2. Now we can extract the click event handler into its own function:

   ```javascript
   function handleNavigation(event) {
     // pull the component name from the text in the anchor tag
     const component = event.target.textContent;

     event.preventDefault();

     // select a piece of the state tree by component
     render(state[component]);
   }
   ```

3. This already helps us clean things up. Check out our new `render` function:

   ```javascript
   function render(state) {
     root.innerHTML = `
       ${Navigation(state)}
       ${Header(state)}
       ${Content(state)}
       ${Footer(state)}
     `;

     document
       .querySelector("#navigation a")
       .addEventListener("click", handleNavigation);

     document
       .querySelector("#navigation li:nth-child(2) > a")
       .addEventListener("click", handleNavigation);

     document
       .querySelector("#navigation li:nth-child(3) > a")
       .addEventListener("click", handleNavigation);
   }
   ```

4. Our last optimization will be to reduce the number of DOM queries every re-render. We're currently querying the entire `document` three times every time `render` is called. We can do better by using `querySelectorAll`, like so:

   ```javascript
   function render(state) {
     root.innerHTML = `
       ${Navigation(state)}
       ${Header(state)}
       ${Content(state)}
       ${Footer(state)}
     `;

     const links = document.querySelectorAll("#navigation a");

     links[0].addEventListener("click", handleNavigation);

     links[1].addEventListener("click", handleNavigation);

     links[2].addEventListener("click", handleNavigation);
   }
   ```

Now we have a pretty clean navigation system that doesn't require page refreshes! How else can we improve on this system?
