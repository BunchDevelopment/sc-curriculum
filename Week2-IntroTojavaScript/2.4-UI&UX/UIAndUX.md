# Basic UI/UX Design #

## Designing your Web Application Interactions##

### User Experience (UX) ###

- Keep it INTUITIVE
  - Navigation should be obvious
- Make it  consistent
  - Follow the "standard" for interactions a.k.a clicking a hamburger icon (![](img/bars-solid.svg)) should open the navigation and arrows (![](img/chevron-left-solid.svg),![](img/chevron-right-solid.svg)) should open drawers.
  - Keep interactions the same across the application
- Allow users to make errors by handlers errors gracefully aka: form validation that asks the user to correct inputs that are not correct

## Design your Web Application Interface ##

### User Interface (UI) ###

#### Responsive Design or Mobile First layout ####
- Rearrange (stack) elements on narrow screens
- Hide/Show different elements based on screen size
- Adjust font sizes, bigger on smaller screens

#### Fonts & Icons ####
- Find alternate fonts for logos and headers to make them stand out.
- Use icons only where appropriate.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

#### Images ####
- Due to copyright law, images need to be your own originals, or licensed Creative Commons or Public Domain

#### Color & Contrast ####
- Pick a color palette and stick to it
- Keep accessibility in mind
  - Visually impaired & colorblind

#### Navigation ####
- Again, it should be intuitive

#### Animations ####
- Only implement after your web app is fully functional
- Can be very time-consuming for little benefit

## Define your Timeline

### How much time do you have to complete your project? ###

- Estimate the amount of time you have on a daily/weekly basis
  - Example: Approximately 2 hours/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks = 40 hours (this is an aggressive timeline)
- This number is used to estimate whether completion of the Capstone project can be done on time
- Plan to complete your capstone project including testing by the Demo Day practice, so you can fine tune & polish the application before Demo Day


## Create your Kanban Board

### Trello.com ###

1. If you don't already have one, create an account on trello.com
1. Create a new board
  - Name the board something meaningful regarding your capstone project
1. Share your board with the Instructors and Teacher's Assistants
1. Create swin lanes which represent each step in the development process
  1. Backlog
    1. Brainstorming and story/defect writing
  1. Ready for development
    1. Story writing completed, full details and acceptance criteria
  1. In Progress
    1. Stories currently being worked (should be limited to 1 or 2)
