# Hack-a-thon 1

## Group Project: Cohort Bio Website
As a class, we will construct a website with professional bios for each individual.

1. clone the [production repo](https://github.com/savvy-coders/in-class-group-project) to your machine
2. create a new branch from the master branch
3. add your name as a contributor in the README
4. in a new html file, create a professional bio page
  - try to include:
    - a picture
    - a paragraph about your career path
    - skills, education, and work history similar to a resume
    - a brief description of your project and a link to your project's GitHub
5. before pushing your branch, pull the master branch to incorporate any changes others have already pushed
6. push your branch to the repo and create a pull request describing your changes
7. peer review your classmates' pull requests
