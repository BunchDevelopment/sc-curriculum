# Week 5b Homework: CSS Practice

## Media Queries Practice

Included in week 5 homework is the HTML file from a site about Andre the Giant.

In the `styles.css` file, fix the styling for the site, and create a media query that fixes the site to correctly display on the "iPhone 6/7/8" view in DevTools.

Focus on the following:

- The `#bio` `<ul>` at the top of the page
- `<img>` tags
- `<div>` tags
- links

> TIP: you may want to copy-paste some already existing css rules into your media query to make sure you are overwriting the necessary rules.
