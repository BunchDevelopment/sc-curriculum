# Node and Server-side JavaScript
**Pre-requisite to this course is to have Node.js installed locally on your computer**

## What is a web server
A web server is a computer/server with the purpose of providing resources requested by clients/other machines. A common example of a web server would be a server receives a request for a web page, and then serves that web pages content back to the client. Web servers typically have more allocated resources than a browser so in a full-stack application, we favor doing cpu heavy tasks on the server.

For our purposes, we will be learning to build a web server that hosts an api that allows us to create, read, update and delete data from a MongoDB database.

## Node.js
Prior to 2013, JavaScript was almost exclusively used client-side, in the browser. What this meant for developers is that they either only worked on the front-end with JavaScript, CSS and HTML or they learned another language that worked on existing server technologies.

In 2008 Google released the Chrome browser as well as the C++ written, V8 JavaScript Engine. The V8 Engine takes JavaScript in and generates optimized, performable machine code from it. The V8 Engine was a major deal because it was able to run JavaScript at a speed that was much faster than what JavaScript developers were used to.

Ryan Dahl in 2009 realized that since the V8 engine had made such a difference for browser based JavaScript, what if JavaScript developers could write the same language server side. This would allow developers to know one language and then use it both client and server side!

Ryan Dahl used the open sourced V8 Engine and then built a wrapper around it in order to allow developers to write javascript, and leverage the underlying C++ libraries and capabilities.

Node.js allows us to write many different kinds of applications outside of just web servers. Node.js is used to help power this code editor VSCode, build command line tools and much more.

What you can accomplish with Node is really left up to your imagination.

## Node Javascript versus Browser JavaScript
There are several differences between JavaScript in the browser and in Node.js. 90% of the time JavaScript will perform the same whether written server side(Node.js), or in the browser. It's good to know some of the gotchas that can catch you off guard, though.
All of the below points will be covered more in depth later in this lesson, but demonstrate some differences between the two operating environments.

  1. In Node.js there is no window object. In the browser the window object holds any global variables
  as well as common apis such as setTimeout and setInterval.
  Node.js has it's own implementation accessed via the 'global' keyword.

---

### **Exercise 1 (Instructor)**
#### Explore the global object: [1-Ins-GlobalExample](10.1-Activities/1-Ins-GlobalExample.js)
```javascript
node ./10.1-Activities/1-Ins-GlobalExample.js
```

When we logged out the global object we saw lots of other methods we have access to. As we learned in the API section last week, the browser gives us access to things like setTimeout and setInterval, etc. Node.js has its own implementation of these APIs to allow developers to still have this functionality outside of the browser.


  2. Another difference is Node.js does not utilize the ES6 module system, but follows the CommonJS module system very closely. We will cover what the CommonJS module system is more in depth next. Just be aware, that the way we import/export in Node.js will be differently than on the front-end.

---

## Modules in Node
Node.js follows the CommonJS module system very closely, which is different to how the ES6 Modules system works. Node.js does not currently support the use of ES6 Modules.
Each JavaScript file can only export one module to be utilized by another module. This module can hold multiple functions or be a standalone entity.

The implementation of imports/exports in Node.js only differs slightly from CommonJS and that is how objects are exported via the module.exports vs. the exports variable.

### Example:
**mathUtilities.js**
```javascript
exports.add = (a, b) => a + b
exports.subtract = (a, b) => a - b
```

Then to import the functions from mathUtilities.js:

**index.js**
```javascript
const mathUtilities = require('./mathUtlities.js')
mathUtilities.add(1, 2)
mathUtilities.subtract(5, 2)
```
You can see in the above we used the keyword **`require`** to import the module. The CommonJS specification uses this to import the module for use. It parses all imports synchronously and in the order that Node.js processes them.

Below are examples of other ways we can export a module:
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b
const subtract = (a, b) => a - b

module.exports = {
    add: add,
    subtract: subtract
}
```

Or you can export just one item at a time via the same method:
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b

module.exports = add
```
To use the above you would then do the following:
```javascript
const mathUtilities = require('./mathUtilities.js')
mathUtilities(1, 2)
```

We've seen how to require locally defined modules, we can also require node_modules in the same manner.
```javascript
const express = require('express')
```
The above will import the express module from our node_modules after we have installed it as a dependency.

---

## Node.js built-in modules
Node.js ships with built-in modules that you can require and use in your code. There are different modules that you can bring in depending on what goal you're trying to accomplish.
Below are some examples:

- Path
    - The Path module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. This module can help normalize paths, determine file extensions, return specific parts of a file path, etc.
- Crypto
    - The Crypto module provides utilities for cryptographic functionality. Useful for creating hashes or working with private/public key infrastructure, etc.
- FS
    - The FS module provides utilities for interacting with the file system. This can be extremely beneficial for reading from, writing to and manipulating files within the server.
- HTTP
    - The HTTP module is used to create an http server with Node. This module is what gives us the ability to listen for HTTP requests and utilize Node as an http web server.

You can learn more about the different built-in modules on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/api/)

---

## Node Environments
Node allows for operating your web server in different environments such as development, staging, test or production. Environments enable you to configure your server to do different things depending on the environment context. As an example, maybe in development you want to disable authenticate requests so you don't have to type your username and password constantly or you want your database to be seeded with special test data. Node's process.env object is what allows us to set these environment specific variables.

For example, we can set process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' when starting the server. We can then have logic around what to do in the 'development' environment.

Process.env is just an object that will return the user's environment and any additional data you add to it.


On a Mac, to start your server with the process.env environment to "Development" you would run the following command in the terminal:
```javascript
NODE_ENV=Development node pathToFileToStart
```
Note in the above that there are no spaces before or after the equals sign.

On a Windows PC the command is slightly different. To start your server with the process.env environment to "Development" you would run the following command in the command prompt:
```javascript
set NODE_ENV=Development&&node pathToFileToStart
```

Later we will go over creating start scripts that will do this for you and make it much easier rather than remembering a full set of commands.

## Instructor-lead activities:
The following activies demonstrate basic Node.js capabilities.

### Activity 2 (Everyone)
#### Manipulating the file system
We are going to build a small app that when ran can read text from a file and display it in the console.

1. First we are going to create a file that will hold our program
```javascript
touch activity_2.js
```
2. Now we need to import the File Systems module so we can utilize its capabilities
```javascript
const fs = require('fs')
```
3. We are also going to go ahead and import the Path module. We will go over why shortly
```javascript
const path = require("path");
```
4. Next create a text file in the same directory and put a few words in there. These will be the words that we'll eventually print to the console
```javascript
touch example.txt
```
5. Now we are going to implement a file system method to read a file. The method is called readFile. The [documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfilesync_path_options) tells us that the readFile function takes:
    1. A path parameter
    2. An optional options object
    3. A callback function giving us access to any errors encountered, or the data itself
Instead of just passing the path such as:
```javascript
./example.txt
```
we are going to use two new methods. The first being path.join.

    1. The path.join method joins all given path segments together using the platform-specific separator as a delimiter, then normalizes the resulting path.
    For example: path.join('/path1', './path2.txt') === '/path1/path2.txt'

    2. The other method we are going to utilize is a global like method given to us by Node called __dirname. __dirname returns the absolute path to the directory of the module being executed. The reason we do this is that depending on where node was ran from, if we simply try to access **./filepath** it would look for the file relative to where our Node server was being ran from and not where the file is actually located. Writing it in this way allows us to specify we want this specific file in this directory to be executed, not relative to where the application is started from.
    The end result will look like:

```javascript
path.join(__dirname, "example.txt")
```

7. The second parameter is an option options object, which we will pass in because the documentation tells us that if we want to read the contents in the file, we need to pass the encoding. Txt files are, by default, encoded as 'utf-8'.
```javascript
 { encoding: "utf-8" }
```
8. The third parameter is a callback function. The callback function should accept an error parameter as well as a file parameter which will hold our results
```javascript
 { encoding: "utf-8" }
```
9. Add a console log for both the error and the file and let's run the program
```javascript
  (err, file) => {
    console.log("Error: ", err);
    console.log("File: ", file);
  }
```
10. Start our program using the command
```javascript
node ./filepath
```

## Activity 3: Implementing a basic server using the HTTP module
In this activity we are going to build out a very basic server that will respond to the client with text. This is going to be our first look at how web servers are built, and later we will learn how to simplify building one using a framework called Express.js.

1. Same as the last activity, let's create a new file to hold our program and import the http module
```javascript
touch basic_server.js
const http = require('http');
```

2. Let's first define a server variable that is going to hold the basic framework of our server. Assign the server variable the http.createServer method. This method takes an options object and a request listener function.
We want to see incoming requests so we are going to pass a function to the object accepting two parameters: req and res. We will go over more about req and res in the Express chapter, but for the time being req is the incoming request and res will handle the outgoing response
```javascript
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {});
```
3. Add a console log to the request listener that logs out req.url
```javascript
console.log(req.url)
```
4. Now create a PORT constant variable with the assigned value of
```javascript
process.env.PORT || 3000
```
We add process.env.PORT as this is a commonly used variable in staging/production areas so that it will run on the proper port depending on operation environment

5. Next we need to tell our server which port to listen on using a method on the object that createServer returns called listen. When picking a port to use, we need to make sure that we don't listen on a port that another program or utility is using. By default I normally pick port 3000 for development. Call the server.listen method and pass in the port created in step 4.
```javascript
server.listen(PORT);
```
6. Add a console log after the listening method that let's us know when the server is running:
```javascript
console.log(`Listening on Port: ${PORT}`);
```
7. Start our program using the command:
```javascript
node ./basic_server.js
```

8. Now if we try to access the server via a browser we should see the path accessing it.
Try adding /home or something after localhost:PORT to see the req.url change

We're going to now start building out different endpoints so our server can serve different content based on the client's request. We have already seen that req.url is giving us access the the url request by the client. We can use this to write logic around what information to respond with.

9. Let's start with creating an if block that will only respond if req.url === "/" (the root of our server)
```javascript
  if (req.url === "/") {
  }
```
10. Inside the if block there are several items we are going to set on the response. First we want to set the headers that will be sent back using the writeHead method of the response object. The writeHead method accepts a status code, optional status message and optional options object. We are going to set the status code to 200 which is the standard HTTP response for success and then an options object containing a Content-Type equal to application/json since that is what we will be sending back.
```javascript
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
```
11. Next we are going to utilize the response objects method of write to write data to the client.
```javascript
res.write("Welcome to the main page");
```
12. We will call response's end method to tell the server we are finished with this request/response cycle.
```javascript
res.end();
```
13. Now let's try to get this data from the browser
14. Optional: build out a "/home" endpoint to send back content-type of text/html
