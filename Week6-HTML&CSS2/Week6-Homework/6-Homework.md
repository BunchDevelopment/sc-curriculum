# Week 6 Homework: Flexbox Froggy

## Flexbox Practice
Go to [flexboxfroggy.com](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and complete at least half (12), if not all the activities.

Send a screenshot of your progress to your TA when you are finished.

## Media Queries Practice
I've included the HTML and CSS files from Week 4's example homework solution (the site about Andre the Giant). In `styles.css`, create a media query that fixes the style issues on the "iPhone 6/7/8" view in DevTools.

Focus on the following:
 - The `#bio` `<ul>` at the top of the page
 - `<img>` tags
 - `<div>` tags
 - links

> TIP: you may want to copy-paste some already existing css rules into your media query to make sure you are overwriting the necessary rules.

## Bonus Challenge
In a .js file, create a few classes. Create one "general category" class, then two more specific classes which extend from the first class.

For example, perhaps you are creating a webstore that sells video games and game consoles. You could create a general `Item` class that holds properties that any and every item for sale shares in common, like `id`, `name`, or `price`. Then, extend `Item` with a class for `GameConsoles` and a class for `VideoGames` and include properties specific to each _category_ of item.
