- Focus on page flow not content of pages
- Make sure you analyze all user flows, creating multiple flow charts if necessary.

## Create Wire Frames ##

#### Now that you think you know what you want to create.

- The wireframes should be crude.  We are not creating comps.
- Start with pencil and paper or whiteboard
   - Then if desired, move into a digital version.
- Create at least one per page.
   - If a page has suffocated user interaction, multiple wireframes for a single page may be required.
- Create wireframes for both different screen sizes.  I.E.: mobile and desktop.
- They should be proportionally correct.
- They should identify the content to be placed on each page but not display actual content.
- They should annotate any user interactions.

#### Start with pencil and paper or whiteboard, then if necessary create a digital version
