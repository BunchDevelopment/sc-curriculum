## Bonus Challenge
In a .js file, create a few classes. Create one "general category" class, then two more specific classes which extend from the first class.

For example, perhaps you are creating a webstore that sells video games and game consoles. You could create a general `Item` class that holds properties that any and every item for sale shares in common, like `id`, `name`, or `price`. Then, extend `Item` with a class for `GameConsoles` and a class for `VideoGames` and include properties specific to each _category_ of item.
