# Protocols, HTTP and REST
The next few sections are going to cover Protocols in general, what HTTP actually is and how REST helps us build an easy to utilize web server.

## Protocols
When we mention protocols such as: HTTP, TCP, IP, etc. What we are referring to is a specification for a way to interact with and exchange data between systems via a network or some sort of connection.
Protocols are what allow us to standardize the transfer of data or in other words, define how those systems can talk to each other.
​
Without protocols we would have to learn how to interact with every web server as it could be different. Having one standard protocol makes our jobs as developers much easier.
​
Let's take a look at what HTTP actually is and what it defines for us.

## HTTP
HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol is largely used to power the World Wide Web by allowing the transfer of documents "over the wire". It defines two roles, those being the "client" and the "server".
The role of the client is to request access to specific data and the server that then responds with the requested data, if the server is unable to return the data it will send a status code telling the client why.
​
We are familiar with this **request and response** cycle in the following type of transaction.
​
In the browser you type in:

```
www.google.com
```
Your browser then shows you the google home page.
​
As we're aware, what is happening is a network request is being made, via HTTP or HTTP/S to the Google servers. In this case there is no authentication that needs to occur, so the google server sends back an html(hypertext markup language) document that is displayed on the client.
​

Moving back to discussing the HTTP protocol, the protocol itself defines the syntax to transfer documents back and forth across a network. Although HTTP typically relates to text based document transfers, but it can also send payloads of different types. This is where HTTP headers really come in to play!
​

HTTP requests are made up of two things: the header and the body. The header of an HTTP request can contain a wide-array of different data to describe to either the client or the server how to handle this data, what it can and can't do with it and a status.
When a request is sent to a server for data, one of they key pieces of data in the header is what type of request is being requested. When we are requesting a website we use a GET request, because we are "Getting" data. We will go over the other main HTTP verbs in a few lessons.
​

When the server receives a request one of the first things it will do is check to see what kind of HTTP verb was requested. It will then figure out what set of instructions to use based on what the HTTP verb and route (i.e. google.com) match up. The server will then gather the necessary resources and prepare a response for the client.

In the response, the server will provide again a header and body. The header will tell the client what kind of encoding and data it holds, which helps tell the browser how to display/what to do with the data.
It will also send the resources as part of the response body.
​

The above is a brief look at how HTTP enables the request/response cycle between a web based client and server. There is much more to truly understand HTTP but that is outside of of the scope of what needs to be understood at this point.
For the time being, I want you to understand that we are utilizing HTTP as the protocol that allows us to communicate via a network between client and server.

### Activity

1. Navigate in a Chrome browser to [google.com](www.google.com).
2. Right click on the page and click inspect
3. Click on the network tab
4. Refresh the webpage
5. Click on the record that says google.com in the network tab
6. Take a look at the request as well as the response section.
   There is a lot going on since this is a Google page that may not be as common on another webpage. This gives a really good example of what both a request and response look like.
   ​
> **NOTE**: Utilizing the network tab is something you will utilize fairly heavily when debugging. It allows you to see the payloads you sent with a request and also what was received back.

## HTTP Verbs

We've briefly discussed GET requests to fetch data/a webpage. Now we're going to discuss different methods for adding data and updating data.

#### Primary HTTP Methods

1. **GET** - Used to fetch resources being data from a database, a web page or other resources
2. **POST** - Used to create new records or data. This will typically be by adding the information to a database or something similar
3. **PUT** - Is used to update existing information. For example, changing the username or date of birth for an existing user
4. **DELETE** - Used to delete or remove entries
   ​
HTTP offers many different ways to interact with a web server and tries to keep requests semantic. Meaning if you want to _get_ data, you use the synonymous _GET_ request.


These methods have very little difference in how they interact and are more semantic about what kind of operation is going to occur. There are slight variations about the types of payloads they can accept, but this will be discussed more once we begin building our servers.


There are more HTTP methods that can be utilized depending on what actions your server is doing. You can see an exhaustive list in the [Mozilla documentation on HTTP Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
​
## REST
Now that we have talked a bit about what protocols are, what hypertext transfer protocol is and why we use it, we are going to discuss a best practice/architectural pattern that is widely used for building web based APIs.
​

REST, or Representational State Transfer (you will hear RESTful used to describe a REST based application) is an architectural pattern used by API developers to standardize their design and use of APIs to make it easy to consume by other developers.
​
A RESTful application has 6 core values, each of which we will discuss:

1. Client Server Separation
2. Stateless
3. Uniform Interface
4. Cacheable Resources
5. Layered System
6. Code on Demand​

#### Client Server Separation
To have a fully REST compliant application the client must be separated from the server and interact via a request-response cycle.
​
#### Stateless
A REST application is stateless. Lets take a look at what this means:


1. _Client_: Sends a request to the server requesting a web page and tells the server that user X is accessing the data
​
2. _Server_: Determines that user X has access to this page/data and sends the requested information in the response
​
3. _Client_: Now requests new data that only certain users have access to, but does not send the current user
​
4. _Server_: Will not respond with the data requested because it has no knowledge of the previous request, so it doesn't know what user wants access to the data

Every time a request is received by the server it is a brand new request and cannot rely on any previous request's information unless that data was stored in some way.
​
#### Uniform Resouces
All routes for accessing resources should be handled in a simple, standardized, non-redundant way. Routes should represent the resource they provide to the client.
​
Let's look at an example that would handle fetching _friends_ as well as one to fetch _acquaintances_. Following REST, the route to fetch friends would look something like:

```
/friends
```
and for acquaintances:
```
/acquaintances
```
A GET request to a route such as those above would be expected to return _all_ of the requested keyword i.e. friends or acquaintances.
​

> **NOTE**: The idea behind uniform resources is that once a developer learns how to utilize one route from your API, they should be able to easily use any others that are offered.
​

Taking the above examples further to demonstrate the other methods.
In the example, we could assume if we made a **DELETE** request to the `/friends` route, that we could delete a friendship that was saved. The API would require more information than just making a delete request to that route, but we will be covering how to pass information later on.
​

As we have seen above, you can have multiple routes that respond to different verbs.
You could have a route like `/friends` that did something different depending on if it was requested via a GET, PUT, POST or DELETE request.
